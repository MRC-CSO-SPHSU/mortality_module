  adresp15_dv:

If she is not present in the household, the following others are assigned the role in that priority order: biological father, step or adoptive mother, step or adoptive father, grandmother, grandfather, foster mother, foster father.

  age_dv:
    Label: "Age, in completed years, at the time of interview. Calculated from the date of birth held in the sample administration database and the interview date. This is conceptually different from dvage which measures the age at the time eligibility for the interview is determined (typically at the time of household enumeration). Uses current and previous wave values of dvage to compute doby_dv where missing. Recorded to missing sample members whose interview outcome is inconsistent with the suggested age +/- one year. DOB month DOBM_DV is made available in UKDS SN6931 only. DOB day (DOBD_DV) is made available in UKDS SN6676 only. "

If an individual aged 16-18 and in full time education did not receive an interview (to determine their educational status), they were assumed to be dependent children. It does not include any children who have a spouse, partner or child living in the household. See depchl_dv_public.do for the do file.

  doby_dv:
    Label: Date of birth, year. Taken from the sample member’s latest enumeration in the study. Not defined for BHPS wave 1-18 respondents who were never enumerated in the UKHLS. Recorded to missing for sample members whose interview outcome is inconsistent with the suggested age +/- one year.

  doby_if:
    Label: DOB Year imputation flag
    Type: indicator

  dvage:
    Label: The age of the respondent at last birthday. This is derived from the exact date of birth and the date of the interview. Where the date of birth information is missing, the estimated age is used. In Wave 6, the information is edited post-field to incorporate cross-wave checked information collected elsewhere (e.g., later in the interview, in an earlier interview, or in an interview with another member of the household). First, DOB information from the individual interview in Wave 6 is used. If missing, the confirmed DOB information on the INDALL data file is used. If missing, additional sources from previous interviews are used. The age is computed from the DOB and the date of interview (i.e., the date the household grid was completed). For a small number of cases with no DOB information, the original age variable is used.
